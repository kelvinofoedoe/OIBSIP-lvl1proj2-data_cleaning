Data cleaning corrects or removes inaccurate, duplicate, or incomplete data, ensuring reliable outcomes in analysis. It's vital for demonstrating proficiency in data analysis.


Data cleaning involves rectifying or eliminating inaccurate, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete data in a dataset. This crucial step ensures the integrity of analysis outcomes. In my approach, I employed Google Sheets' formulas to detect and remove duplicates while also handling special characters. Additionally, I replaced missing values with appropriate placeholders to maintain data coherence. To ensure thoroughness, I cross-checked the cleaned dataset with SQL queries, confirming its suitability for analysis. This meticulous process underscores the significance of robust data cleaning skills in facilitating accurate and reliable insights.
